Project Title
SmartWasteAI: AI-Powered Smart Waste Management System

Final project for the Building AI course

Summary
SmartWasteAI uses computer vision and machine learning to detect, sort, and analyze waste types from camera input to automate recycling and reduce landfill waste. This project supports smart city sustainability goals and eco-friendly behavior.

Background
Improper waste disposal and lack of recycling are critical environmental problems in cities around the world. Landfills are overflowing, and recyclable materials often end up in the trash due to lack of awareness or infrastructure.

My motivation for this project comes from witnessing poor waste management in my own community. I wanted to create a system that could make sorting easier and promote responsible recycling habits using AI.

This idea addresses:

The incorrect sorting of household or industrial waste

The low recycling rates due to poor accessibility or education

The need for smart, eco-conscious solutions in cities

How is it used?
SmartWasteAI is installed at waste collection points (homes, offices, or recycling centers). A camera captures an image of the item to be discarded. The AI model classifies the item (e.g., plastic, glass, organic, metal, paper) and lights up the correct bin for disposal.

Users:

Citizens at recycling bins

Municipal waste management departments

Smart city developers

Data sources and AI methods
Data:

Open datasets such as TrashNet for labeled waste images

Custom data collected from local waste sorting centers

AI Techniques:

Image classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Transfer learning using pre-trained models like MobileNet or ResNet

Possible real-time detection with TensorFlow Lite for edge devices

# Sample model training code snippet
from tensorflow.keras.applications import MobileNetV2
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D

model = Sequential([
    MobileNetV2(include_top=False, input_shape=(224,224,3)),
    GlobalAveragePooling2D(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(5, activation='softmax')  # 5 classes: plastic, glass, metal, paper, organic
])
Challenges
Accuracy may vary with dirty or deformed items

Hardware deployment (camera + microcontroller) needs real-world testing

Privacy concerns for public installation of cameras

Cannot fully replace human decision-making in complex sorting cases

What next?
Build a working prototype using Raspberry Pi + Camera Module

Partner with local recycling programs for pilot testing

Add multilingual voice guidance for inclusive use

Integrate with mobile apps for usage data tracking and incentives
